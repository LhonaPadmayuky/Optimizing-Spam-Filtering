# Optimizing Spam Filtering

This project focuses on building and optimizing a machine learning-based **Spam Filtering System**. The goal is to efficiently classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham) using various machine learning algorithms. The project also involves experimenting with different models to optimize the accuracy and performance of the spam filter.

## Features

- **Spam Detection:** Classifies messages into spam or ham (non-spam).
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Uses multiple machine learning models such as:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Feature Engineering:** Includes methods like text vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag of Words).
- **Model Evaluation:** Provides model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of SMS messages labeled as **spam** or **ham**. This is typically sourced from publicly available datasets are **Kaggle Datasets**.

- **Number of samples:** 5,000+ messages
- **Features:** Message content (text), label (spam/ham)

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models and feature extraction.
- **Numpy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
